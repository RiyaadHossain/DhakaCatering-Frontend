              A public eating establishment similar to a restaurant is mentioned
              in a 512 BC record from Ancient Egypt. It served only one dish, a
              plate of cereal, wild fowl, and onions. A forerunner of the modern
              restaurant is the thermopolium, an establishment in Ancient Greece
              and Ancient Rome that sold and served ready-to-eat food and
              beverages. These establishments were somewhat comparable to modern
              fast food restaurants. They were most often frequented by people
              who lacked private kitchens. In the Roman Empire they were popular
              among residents of insulae. In Pompeii, 158 thermopolia with
              service counters have been identified throughout the town.
