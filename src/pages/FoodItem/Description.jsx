        Food is one of the basic necessities of life. Food contains
        nutrientsâ€”substances essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance
        of body tissues and for the regulation of vital processes. Nutrients
        provide the energy our bodies need to function. The energy in food is
        measured in units called calories.

        Age, sex, weight, height, and level of activity determine the number of
        calories a person needs each day. Depending on age, sex, and activity
        level, the recommended daily caloric intake for a child aged 11 to 14
        can range anywhere from 1,600 to 2,600 calories per day, with sedentary
        girls needing the fewest calories and active boys needing the most. For
        adults, this can range from 1,800 to about 3,000.
